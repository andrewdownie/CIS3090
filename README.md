# CIS3090 - Parallel Programming
 Andrew Downie - University of Guelph - 2015 Fall Semester
 
 The general idea of this course was to write two versions of a program: a serial and a parallel version.
 Then to compare the serial programs performance vs. the parallel programs performance and figure out how to make the parallel program run faster. 
This involved studying parallel algorithms and understanding what happens at the hardware level that could impede parallel program performance (most notably memory sharing).
